                <h3>What's the problem?</h3>
                <p>Most Effects Pedals for electronic instruments are made for experienced musicians who what a specific sound and effect. The musician must know ahead of time what each pedal does. Someone who does not understand sound design and music theory would need to conduct research into each pedal before buying. The effects used in the effects pedal change the tone from how the instrument sounds normally, referred to as clean by guitarists, into a new effect dictated by what the effects pedal does. For example, an electric guitarist could use a distortion pedal, which makes the guitar sound louder and messier. This sound can be heard in most rock, metal, and other genres of music. The pedal aspect of each device refers to how guitarists will interact with the device by pushing a button which turns the effect on and off.

                <h3>Our goal</h3>
                <p>The Descriptive Effects Pedal, DEP for short, is a new effect pedal for electronic instruments that uses descriptions of musical sounds to change the output signal of the connected instrument.  The DEP will be primarily used with instruments who are electric by nature such as an electric guitar or an electronic keyboard. The device serves to aid those who are aspiring to learn about effects for their instrument, without any sound design or music theory background. The DEP will allow a user to describe the sound of the instrument they want to create by selecting pre-programmed descriptions. These descriptions correspond to digital effects that will take the input sound of the connected instrument and shape it into a sound in which they describe. This sound can either be played through the on-board speakers, or though other connected devices such as a speaker or headphones.</p>
